[_Link to Media Library PHP Database App:_](https://php-databases.herokuapp.com/)
A Treehouse Tutorial on Querying a Database and using it's data to display on screen. 

This is an extension of one of my other Treehouse PHP projects where we create a media library. The working version uses a sqlite database. as of right now, I am actively trying to migrate over to a MySQL database, because Heroku doesn't support sqlite. 

The heroku app still needs some bugs worked out, but you can still see some of the app.
